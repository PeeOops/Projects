Notes:
1. "$this" or "this" method is used to call a local variable where it is needed to be access by outside function

Example:

<!-- We declare a new private routes with empty array -->
private $routes = [];

<!-- Make a  new function called get that accept 2 default parameters $uri and $controller to return routes-->
public function get($uri = '/',$controller = 'index.php'){
    $this->routes[] = [
        'uri' => $uri,
        'controller' => $controller
    ]

    return $this;
}

<!-- make a function called router to show the routes and return an array -->
public function router(){
    foreach($this->routes as $route){
        return $route;
    }
}






Routing Steps:

1. New file call "routes.php"
    - To accept uri and controller
    example:
    $router->get('/','index.php');
    = Class name router with a method GET where the uri is '/' and controller 'index.php'

2. New file call "router.php" in Core
    - To make methods like GET,POST,DELETE,PUT,PATCH
